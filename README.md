#Features
Main feature of this design is that it adds another joint with 360 angle of movement, other also notable features are:
  Low Profile - Inspired by Elgato Wave Mic Arm LP
  Larger joint grip area - Additional hole for tightening screw in the middle of the joint, gripping walls of the extrusions more effectively than Tertial's design
  
  Required materials - Only additional hardware needed for the conversion are M4 screws, which most likely you already have around

#Requierments/Part list
3D printer, all parts are printable even on Voron 0 size printers.
Roughly ~*XX*g plastic (I used ASA but generic PLA should be fine) 
M4-22mm Screws x4
Grease, used to make 360 joints rotate smooth

Optional:
  tbd...


#Instructions
Teardown of the lamp, nothing difficult there.
Print orientation - suggestion is to print joints with holes vertically, others with studs horizontally.
