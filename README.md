# Tiramisu
Budget and rigid microphone stand costing only around 8$ (cost of plastic) considering you have a donor Tertial lamp.

## Features

Main feature of this design is that it adds two  joints with 360 angle of movement, other also notable features are:
* Larger joint grip area - Additional hole for tightening screw in the middle of the joint, gripping walls of the extrusions more effectively than Tertial's design
* Low amount of materials - Other that filament only additional hardware needed for the conversion are M4 screws (or M4 threaded rod)
* Voron 0 friendly
> Original springs can be used if desired, cap's that hold springs are mountable on tightening screw hole, however additional 35mm M4 rod will be required.

## 3D Printing

Most important thing is to **print joints vertically** with 100% infill,
Tested and recommended material is PETG.

### Failures

First few prints of the joints broke after tightening however, part printed vertically was still able to be tightened.
> [!WARNING]  
> If you print with infill less than 100% joints may break when tightening,
> Print settings used on these parts are ABS+ 40% Cubic Infill.

## Requirements/Part list

* IKEA's Terteal Lamp
* M4 - 28mm Screws x4
* Plastic ~260g (PETG recommended)
* Grease (for rotating joints)

Optional:

* M3 - 8mm or larger (for securing 2nd and 3rd joint)

## Assembly

Build process should be quite self explanatory so I will write down only important notes.

Additional plugs (Plug_Full) should be printed and inserted in extrusions (rods) to make them stiffer,
you can **re-use 4 original cable routing plugs** or print them as well (Plug_Hollow).

Tolerances on joints are TIGHT and that's by design, sanding of round 360 degree joints is required to adjust fit and grease is only used on **1st_Joint** and **3rd_Joint**.

<ins>When assembly is completed all joints need to be tightened to minimize side tilt.<ins>
