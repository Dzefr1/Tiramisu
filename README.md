# Tiramisu
Budget and rigid microphone stand costing only around 8$ considering you have donor Tertial lamp.

Conversion of IKEA's Terteal Lamp to microphone arm (holder)



## Features

Main feature of this design is that it adds two  joints with 360 angle of movement, other also notable features are:
* Larger joint grip area - Additional hole for tightening screw in the middle of the joint, gripping walls of the extrusions more effectively than Tertial's design
* Low amount of materials - Other that fillament only additional hardware needed for the conversion are M4 screws (or M4 threaded rod)
* Voron 0 friendly

> Original springs can be used if desired, cap's that hold springs are mountable on tightening screwhole, however additional 35mm M4 rod will be required.

## 3D Printing

Most important thing is to **print joints vertically** with 100% infill,

Recomended material is PETG due to bend in the joints.

### Failures

First few prints of the joints broke after tightrning
> [!WARNING]  
> If you print with infill less than 100% joints may break when tightening,
> Print settings used on these parts are ABS+ 40% Cubic Infill.

## Assembly

Lamp needs to be teardown
Additional plugs (Plug_Full) should be printed and inserted in extrusions (rods) to make them stiffer,
you can re-use 4 original cable routing plugs or print them as well (Plug_Hollow).
